# Small programs in Python 

In this repository is designed to show small projects created in Python, I would recommend that you start using a basic interactive development environment (IDE) to avoid using the "shortcuts" given by them, or you can start with VIM or Emacs, I find them an excellent options to start and learn to program in any language from scratch.

## ¿Why Python?

Python is an excellent option to learn to program. It has a simple syntax that resembles a pseudocode, is too intuitive and easy to learn. Es un lenguaje orientado a objetos.

### Compile
We will create, as tradition says, a hello world.

First we open the terminal, and we move to the folder where we want to create our small program.

```
➜ ~ cd Documents/Python

```
Then we create a new document, either with vim or simply using *touch Hello_World.java*

```
➜ ~ vim Hello_World.py

```
It's so simple to do it, as asking python to print the message.

```python
print("hello World")
~
~
~
~
```
Finally we save it and to compile and execute in terminal we will have to execute the following sentence

```
➜ ~ python Hello_World.py

```
There you have it, your first Python program. Congratulations. Remember not to copy this repository if they left you with a similar school assignment, use it better as a guide, as long as you understand it.
